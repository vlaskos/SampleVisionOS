VisionOS
Research and exploration of basic visionOS capabilities.

Feature 1 involves displaying 3D models in the usdz format in the volumetric windowGroup space.
The standard "Earth" model is provided by Apple, and our custom model.
To be able to process custom models, add gestures, etc.
The Reality Composer Pro utility allows adding necessary components (Collision, Input target for gestures). We can update the model and continue working with it in RealityView.
